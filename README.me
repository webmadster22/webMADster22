Maria Anderson , web designer, programmer and problem solver with an education that covers the basics of most things frontend, but also backend and APIs, databases and more.

Here to try to share some of the things I have done, but also to <strong>explore and learn</strong> new things.

On my spare time I am a creative soul engaging in various creative activities to make the world a more beautiful place to live.
